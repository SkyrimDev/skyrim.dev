Once your SKSE plugin has been successfully built, a `.dll` will be generated.

This is your SKSE plugin.

If you followed the steps to **configure** the SSKE plugin template, the `.dll` should now reside
in either:
- your `Data` folder (_in `Data\SKSE\Plugins\`_)

\- or -
- in your `mods` folder (_in `<mods>\<Template name>\SKSE\Plugins\`_)

You are ready to run Skyrim.

Be sure to run Skyrim via SKSE by running `skse64_loader.exe` directly -_or_-
by running SKSE from your mod manager (_e.g. Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex_)
