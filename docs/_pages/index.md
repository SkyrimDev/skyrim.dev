# Skyrim.dev

> _A comfortable home for Skyrim mod authors_

Welcome to <strike>my</strike> **our** new website.

As modders in the Skyrim community, there was no _shared place_ where **_all of us_** could share our _sample projects_ and **documentation** for:

- Papyrus script code
- C++ SKSE code
- Sample .esp plugin files

There _are_ lots of _lovely_ resources available today, including:

- [https://www.creationkit.com](https://www.creationkit.com)

But that is for Papyrus code. What about C++ code?

Plus, **GitHub** is the best home for _sample projects_.

Let's work together to make this place great and _filled with useful content_.

For now, there might not be much. But please reach out to contibute.

> _As of today, the best way to reach out is to [find me on Discord][Discord]_
>
> _Later, we will setup a more formal contribution model `<3`_

~ **_Enjoy your stay!_** ~
